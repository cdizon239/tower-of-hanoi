<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://cdizon239.github.io/tower-of-hanoi/)

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle that consists of three pegs or towers with n disks placed one over the other. The objective of the puzzle is to move the stack to another peg following these simple rules. Only one disc can be moved at a time. No disc can be placed on top of the smaller disc.

Features:

- Allowing a user to move disks from one peg to another if it is a valid move
- Tracks time and counts the number of moves per turn
- Ability to reset the game
- Increase level / number of discs to solve
- Access to a solve button that also animates how to finish the puzzle
- Access to a table of Best moves per level (i.e. number of discs)
