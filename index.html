          <p>The Tower of Hanoi, also known as the Tower of Brahma, is a puzzle invented by E. Lucas in
          1883. According to legend, in an Indian temple that contains a large room with three poles
          surrounded by 64 golden disks, the priests of Brahma have been moving these golden disks, in
          accordance with the rules of the puzzle. Based on an ancient prophecy, when the last move of the
          puzzle is completed, the world will end. The puzzle has appeared many times in popular culture.
          In the film Rise of the Planet of the Apes in 2011, it appeared as an intelligence test for apes
          under the name "Lucas Tower."
